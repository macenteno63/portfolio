Blizz is part of the Odehus group and is located in Cournon d\u0026rsquo;Auvergne.\nThe focus of my apprenticeship was the creation of the company\u0026rsquo;s intranet. The intranet aims to provide tools to employees that facilitate communication, collaboration, and resource sharing, thereby enhancing operational efficiency.\nI was tasked with developing three applications:\nA photo directory A resource manager A leave manager All these applications had to be integrated into the Microsoft 365 environment. For instance, these applications needed to be accessible to employees through Teams or SharePoint. Some applications also had functionalities like sending Teams notifications, interacting with Outlook calendars, storing information in SharePoint, or retrieving data from Azure Active Directory.\nPhoto Directory # The photo directory displays the organizational hierarchy with photos, names, first names, and job roles of Odehus employees. Thanks to its integration with Azure Active Directory (AD), a service for identity and access management, the directory is always up-to-date, automatically reflecting any changes. Leveraging the hierarchy already present in AD enabled me to build the directory efficiently and in a structured manner.\nResource Manager # An application that allows employees to reserve a car or meeting room via a calendar interface.\nLeave Manager # Allows employees to request time off, check their leave balances, and declare overtime hours.\n","date":"25 June 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/containers/mateocenteno-portfolio/posts/alternance/","section":"Post","summary":"Details of my internship experience and the projects I worked on at Blizz.","title":"Internship Experience at Blizz","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"25 June 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/containers/mateocenteno-portfolio/tags/professionnal-experience/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Professionnal Experience","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"25 June 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/containers/mateocenteno-portfolio/tags/project/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Project","type":"tags"},{"content":"During my third year of my IT Bachelor\u0026rsquo;s degree (BUT informatique), I developed a cross-platform mobile game called \u0026ldquo;Rivall\u0026rdquo; with four of my classmates.\nGame Objective # Our application is a mix between a game and a social network. Users can add friends, modify their profiles, and communicate with each other via messaging. To start a game, a group must be created. At this point, the group members receive quests. The objective is to complete as many quests as possible as quickly as possible.\nOnce a quest is validated by the group members, the player receives points and can view the group\u0026rsquo;s leaderboard. My Contribution # In this project, I set up a REST API with Django Rest Framework. This allowed me to configure the registration and authentication mechanisms for our mobile application. Later in the project, I added a layer to manage the WebSocket protocol, which enabled me to implement instant messaging in our application.\n","date":"25 June 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/containers/mateocenteno-portfolio/posts/rivall/","section":"Post","summary":"A mobile game to challenge your friends","title":"Rivall","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"25 June 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/containers/mateocenteno-portfolio/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"},{"content":" Hello everyone üëã # I am a student at the University Institute of Technology (IUT) in Computer Science at Clermont-Auvergne University.

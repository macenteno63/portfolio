### Hello everyone ðŸ‘‹

I am a student at the University Institute of Technology (IUT) in Computer Science at Clermont-Auvergne University. I have been pursuing this program for three years now, and I am completing this third year as an apprentice at Blizz, a small digital service company.

I am a curious developer interested in various topics in computer science and enjoy trying out everything. During my apprenticeship, I am employed as a web developer since I have had the opportunity to create various applications using `React` and the `SharePoint framework` to develop the company's intranet.

I have also worked on several projects at the IUT, including a cross-platform mobile game/social network with `Flutter` and a REST API with `Django Rest Framework`.

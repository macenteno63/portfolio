### Hello everyone ðŸ‘‹

As a former student of the Computer Science IUT at the University of Clermont-Auvergne, I was lucky enough during my university course to be able to follow a very rich and comprehensive course in the field of computer science. Through tutored projects, I've been able to put into practice the skills I've learnt in theory, and build up solid experience, particularly in the development of web and mobile applications.

I'm a curious developer who's interested in a variety of IT subjects and likes to dabble in everything.I spent my third year at BUT as a web developer, where I had the opportunity to develop various applications using `React` and `SharePoint framework` to develop the company's intranet.

I was also able to work on various projects at the IUT, including a cross-platform mobile game/social network using `Flutter` and an Api Rest using `Django Rest Framework`.

Today, I'm motivated to enter working life and develop my IT skills. In particular, I'd like to become a WebGL developer to master the technologies involved in creating interactive and immersive graphical experiences on the web, using libraries like `Three.js`.
